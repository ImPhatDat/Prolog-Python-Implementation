# Prolog Implementation With Python

## Course: CSC14003 - Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains an ongoing project to implement Prolog functionality using Python. Prolog is a logic programming language that is particularly well-suited for symbolic and symbolic computation tasks. This implementation aims to provide a Python-based interpreter for Prolog programs, allowing users to leverage Prolog's logical inference capabilities within Python applications.

## Status

**Note:** This implementation is currently incomplete and is under development.

## Features

- Basic Prolog syntax parsing
- Limited support for Prolog predicates and rules
- Integration with Python code

## Usage

To use this Prolog implementation within our Python project: run the main.py program first and start to query using prolog syntax.
